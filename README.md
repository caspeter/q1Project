#Read my Face



Read my Face was built for everyone to use, but specifcally for people with autism or asperger syndrome. Some people with autism or aspergers have difficulty reading social cues and emotions.

This site was designed to read emotions from inputted images and display their emotions in a easy to read format. 

This was created with HTML, Materialize, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, jCanvas, jQuery UI and Microsoft Cognitive Services Emotion API.
